# About This Site

## Accessibility Statement

I aim for this website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) level AA. As far as I'm aware, it does.

Here are some of the tools I'm using to test this site for accessibility:

* W3C's HTML validator
* NVDA screen reader on Windows with Firefox and Chrome
* Orca screen reader on Fedora with Firefox and Edge
* axe DevTools browser extension
* tota11y bookmarklet
* WebAIM's color contrast checker

If you come across any accessibility or usability issues on this site, please let me know. You can [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/cncoulter/camcoulter.com/issues) or email me at contact@camcoulter.com.

## Website Design & Hosting

* This site is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
* [This site's codebase](https://github.com/cncoulter/camcoulter.com) is hosted on GitHub.
* View the [ReadMe](/About-This-Site/ReadMe/) page for this site.

I'm using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to knit the site together, and I'm consciously avoiding Jekyll themes and frameworks such as Bootstrap, instead preferring to write all the website code myself.

Please be advised, this website is still very much under development.
