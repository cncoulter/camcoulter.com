## Privacy Policy
{: tabindex="-1"}

I do not collect data about website visitors. There are no analytics on this site. There are no tracking cookies on this site.

This site is hosted with Netlify. If you're interested, here is a link to [Netlify's privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

## Accessibility Statement
{: tabindex="-1"}

I want this site to work well for people with disabilities and people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers, and I aim for this website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) level AA. What does that mean?

* You should be able to navigate this site by keyboard alone or by using assitive technologies like switch controls or voice access.
* You should be able to zoom and increase text size up to 200% (or more) without any loss of content or functionality. When text size is increased and/or on mobile devices, content should reflow nicely without requiring horizontal scrolling (except perhaps for tables).
* Text and interactive controls should have sufficient contrast against background colors so that users can easily read text and identify controls.
* Images should have appropriate textual equivalents (alt text). Controls should have appropriate accessible names, roles, and states so that screen readers properly announce content for users. Screen reader users should be able to effectively read and navigate this site.
* You should be able to navigate this site if CSS or JavaScript fails to load (or if you have JavaScript disabled).

Beyond WCAG, I also want this site to work well for people who use high contrast mode on Windows. (I use this mode myself sometimes, and it can be a huge help.) I have designed and tested this site so that it should work well when viewed in high contrast mode on Windows.

Here are some of the tools I'm using to test this site for accessibility:

* W3C's HTML validator
* NVDA screen reader on Windows with Firefox and Chrome
* Orca screen reader on Fedora with Firefox and Edge
* axe DevTools browser extension
* tota11y bookmarklet
* WebAIM's color contrast checker

If you come across any accessibility or usability issues on this site, please let me know. You can [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/cncoulter/camcoulter.com/issues) or email me at contact@camcoulter.com.

## Website Design & Hosting
{: tabindex="-1"}

* I use the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to knit this site together.
* This site is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
* [This site's codebase](https://github.com/cncoulter/camcoulter.com) is hosted on GitHub.
* View the [ReadMe](/About-This-Site/ReadMe/) page for this site.
* View the [Design Guide](/About-This-Site/Design-Guide/) for this site.

When designing this site, I consciously avoided Jekyll themes and frameworks such as Bootstrap, instead preferring to write pretty much all all the website code myself. I designed this site to be simple, clean, readable, and accessible. This site mostly functions as my personal blog, which includes a blog archive, category index, tag index, and an Atom feed.

This site should work well on both desktop and mobile devices, and the text size should automatically increase slightly on larger screens. The site supports both light and dark modes. (It automatically adjusts according to your browser preference.) Additionally, this site has specially designed print styles, so if you choose to print any page, the printout should render nicely. Decorative images will not print, and URLs will be printed in parenthesis next to external links.
