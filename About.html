<h2>Longer, first-person bio</h2>

<p>I like science fiction and fantasy (SFF), particularly the written kind. I get excited about stories that rethink family structures, imagine intentional communities, pay attention to religion and people of faith, investigate <a href="http://www.bollier.org/new-to-the-commons">the commons</a>, or obliterate gender. I write about SFF on this site as well as on <a href="https://skiffyandfanty.com/author/cameronncoulter/"><cite>Skiffy and Fanty</cite></a>. I'm a member of the <a href="http://sfpoetry.com/">Science Fiction and Fantasy Poetry Association</a> (SFPA), and I enjoy writing SFF fiction and poetry.</p>

<p>I'm a GNOME/Fedora (Linux) user, a big fan of <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">Free Software</a>, and a supporter of the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. I like to make websites and administer GNU/Linux servers.</p>

<p>I'm a graduate of Santa Clara University, and after college I did a year of service with the <a href="http://www.jesuitvolunteers.org/">Jesuit Volunteer Corps</a> in Baltimore, MD. These days, I contribute to and manage <a href="https://theruinedreport.com/"><cite>The Ruined Report</cite></a>, a blog by and for former Jesuit volunteers and friends that features posts about social justice, simple living, community, and spirituality.</p>

<p>Professionally, I work as a digital accessibility consultant, helping to make websites and apps work well for people with disabilities and for people who use assistive technologies like screen readers. I'm a <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional-web-accessibility">Certified Professional in Web Accessibility</a> (CPWA) and a member of the <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/">International Association of Accessibility Professionals</a> (IAAP). Before I started working in digital accessibility, I worked in disability services, starting with two years at <a href="https://www.larcheks.org/">L'Arche Heartland</a>, a community of adults with and without developmental disabilities in the Kansas City metro area.</p>
