I also read a good chunk of short fiction. I'll have another post coming soon in which I shout out my favorite short stories originally published in 2019. But for now, let's review the highlights of the books that I read last year.

## <cite>Born to the Blade</cite>: Season 1
{: tabindex="-1"}

This was my first venture into the world of [Serial Box](https://www.serialbox.com). I [really enjoyed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-09-Recent-Reading %}#born-to-the-blade-season-1-by-michael-r-underwood-marie-brennan-malka-older-cassandra-khaw) this story. I feel a little burned on Serial Box now, though, because this season ended on a cliffhanger, and it looks like there's not going to be a season 2. I would like to read [<cite>The Vela</cite>](https://www.serialbox.com/serials/the-vela) from Serial Box, but I don't want to start it until I know it gets some sort of resolution.

## Favorite Novels
{: tabindex="-1"}

* <cite>Walkaway</cite> by Cory Doctorow: a fun and fascinating novel about the end of capitalism and the end of death. [I absolutely loved it.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-09-Recent-Reading %}#walkaway-by-cory-doctorow)
* <cite>The Grace of Kings</cite> and <cite>The Wall of Storms</cite> by Ken Liu: Just wow. These books are stunning achievements. I'm dying to read book three in this series. More of my thoughts [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-20-Recent-Reading %}#the-grace-of-kings-and-the-wall-of-storms-by-ken-liu).
* <cite>The Wild Dead</cite> by Carrie Vaugh: a tremendously fun and smart post-apocalyptic murder mystery. It's a sequel to [<cite>Bannerless</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-01-Reading %}#bannerless-by-carrie-vaughn), which I also loved.
* <cite>The Raven Tower</cite> by Ann Leckie: This is Ann Leckie's new book. Therefore, it is superb.
* <cite>The Fifth Season</cite> by N.K. Jemisin: I now understand why this series won all the Hugos. I am really looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.

## Favorite Novellas
{: tabindex="-1"}

Two standout novellas that I read last year were <cite>In an Absent Dream</cite> by Seanan McGuire and <cite>The Stars Change</cite> by Mary Anne Mohanraj.

<cite>In an Absent Dream</cite> is the latest book in McGuire's Wayward Children series. This book was wonderful. The series is phenomenal. Here are my thoughts on the first three books in the series: [<cite>Every Heart a Doorway</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-12-Every-Heart-a-Doorway %}), [<cite>Down Among the Sticks and Bones</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-25-Reading %}#down-among-the-sticks-and-bones-by-seanan-mcguire), and [<cite>Beneath the Sugar Sky</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-08-Reading %}#beneath-the-sugar-sky-by-seanan-mcguire).

<cite>The Stars Change</cite> is amazing. [Check here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-09-Recent-Reading %}#the-stars-change-by-mary-anne-mohanraj) for my thoughts on it.

## Comics!
{: tabindex="-1"}

<cite>Our Super Adventure: Video Games and Pizza Parties</cite> by Sarah Graley & Stef Purenins was delightful. If you're unfamiliar with their cute, geeky diary comic [<cite>Our Super Adventure</cite>](https://www.oursuperadventure.com/), you should definitely check it out.

I've also been reading Dana Simpson's [<cite>Phoebe and Her Unicorn</cite>](https://www.gocomics.com/phoebe-and-her-unicorn) books. Again, if you haven't read these, you gotta check them out. This comic series rivals (and honestly I enjoy more than) <cite>Calvin and Hobbes</cite> and <cite>The Peanuts</cite>. I particularly loved <cite>Phoebe and Her Unicorn in The Magic Storm</cite>, which was a graphic novel rather than a collection of individual strips.

Related, you should also definitely be following [<cite>Pepper & Carrot</cite>](https://www.peppercarrot.com/), a gorgeous and funny web comic about a young witch and her cat.

## Nonfiction Hits
{: tabindex="-1"}

Here are my favorite nonfiction reads from 2019:

* [<cite>A People’s History of the United States</cite> by Howard Zinn]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-06-Peoples-History %}): the critical view of US American history that they don't teach you (but should) in school
* <cite>Sex and the Constitution: Sex, Religion, and Law from America’s Origins to the Twenty-First Century</cite> by Geoffrey R. Stone: an engaging, deeply informative, and actually really fun read all about sex, contraception, abortion, same-sex marriage, censorship, obscenity, morality, religion, and law in the US.
* <cite>The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life</cite> by David Brooks: a thoughtful and persuasive book in which David Brooks argues that lives of meaning and purpose are rooted in commitments to a spouse and a family, to a vocation, to a philosophy or faith, and to a local community.
* <cite>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</cite> by Cal Newport: an easy, interesting, and persuasive read. Somewhat counter-intuitive. Newport argues that rather than following your preexisting passions, you should instead cultivate rare and valuable skills in order to have a successful career that you enjoy.
* <cite>Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones</cite> by James Clear: an engaging, informative, and easy read all about habits. If you want to cultivate good habits, start here.
