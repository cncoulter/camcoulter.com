<p class="bookinfo">New York: Orbit, 2015. Originally published in June 2014.</p>

<cite>Cibola Burn</cite> is the fourth book in <cite>The Expanse</cite> series by James S. A. Corey, the pen name for Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck. After reading <cite>Cibola Burn</cite>, it’s official: <cite>The Expanse</cite> is the most fun reading I’ve ever done --- including <cite>Harry Potter</cite>.

<cite>The Expanse</cite> tells the story of humanity 200 years in the future. We’ve colonized the solar system, and we’re just starting to reach beyond it. It’s a space opera that wraps action, adventure, mystery, horror, and political intrigue all around great human characters.

<cite>Cibola Burn</cite> wasn’t my favorite book in the series, but I still greatly enjoyed it. I enjoyed all the point-of-view characters, I found the character’s problems to be interesting, and the pacing felt just right. It had smaller stakes than the first three books in the series, but since I loved all the characters, I didn’t mind; I was sufficiently invested. In contrast, while I loved the drama and conflict of the previous book, <cite>Abaddon’s Gate</cite>, I didn’t care for one of the POV characters and the last fourth of the book felt overly grueling.

This series is stupendously fun. I highly recommend to all. Go start with the first book in the series: <cite>Leviathan Wakes</cite>. You’re in for a treat. Also, check out the TV series adaptation; season one of <cite>The Expanse</cite> premiered on Syfy this last December. It was awesome.

Oh, and be warned: these books are binge reads. They will demand it.
