I recently received word from the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) that I am now a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Compentencies (CPACC). Yay! You can now find my name on IAAP's [list of CPACC certificants](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/cpacc-certificants).

The certification exam has three domains: (1) Disabilities, Challenges, & Assistive Technologies; (2) Accessibility and Universal Design; and (3) Declarations, Standards, Laws, and Management Strategies. According to IAAP, I scored "above standard" in all three domains. Yay!

I feel happy, relieved, and grateful. See my last post, [CPACC Reflection]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-07-21-CPACC-Reflection %}), for more of my thoughts on the exam itself, on preparing for it, and on my next steps.
