I recently finished designing [Graph Paper](https://graphpaper.cncoulter.com/), a Jekyll website integrated with Bootstrap and packed with all the features you'd expect in a modern website/blog, such as support for multiple authors, tags and categories, comments, and more. It's intended to be a template that you can quickly fork in order to get a new website up and running. For more on this project, check out [a recent blog post I wrote](https://graphpaper.cncoulter.com/2020/05/30/Welcome-to-Graph-Paper/) for the project where I share more about what it is and why I made it.
