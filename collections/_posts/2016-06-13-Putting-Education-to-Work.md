description: It feels appropriate to have read this as my service year is winding down.

<p class="bookinfo">New York: HarperOne, 2014.</p>

Before I started my year of service at Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Baltimore, I read <cite>More Than a Dream: The Cristo Rey Story</cite> by G. R. Kearney, which tells the story of the first Cristo Rey school in Chicago. I found the book to be detailed, interesting narrative nonfiction, and I appreciated the fodder for reflection on my upcoming year.

<cite>Putting Education to Work</cite> feels like a sequel to <cite>More Than a Dream</cite>, so it feels appropriate to have read it as the service year is winding down. Where <cite>More Than a Dream</cite> tells the story of the original Cristo Rey high school, <cite>Putting Education to Work</cite> is concerned with the Cristo Rey Network of schools and its national impact. <cite>Putting Education to Work</cite> reads less like narrative nonfiction and more like a policy paper, which makes the book somewhat dull. However, since itâ€™s a short book (six chapters; less than 250 pages), I finished it before it really began to feel tiresome.

For a brief, readable, academic introduction to Cristo Rey schools, <cite>Putting Education to Work</cite> fits the bill. However, I would recommend the average reader first read <cite>More Than a Dream</cite> and then pick up <cite>Putting Education to Work</cite> as a detailed afterword.
