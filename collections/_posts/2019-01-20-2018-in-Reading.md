Let's review the highlights.

## Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim
{: tabindex="-1"}

[Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrotsvitha) is so awesome and I love her. She's a 10th-century German canoness, dramatist, and poet who attempted to christianize the work of Terence, the Roman comic playwright. I reread her plays at the start of 2018 and [blogged]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-08-Reading %}#the-plays-of-roswitha-translated-by-christopher-st-john) about them.

This year, now that work from 1923 has finally, definitively entered the public domain, an English translation of her plays is now in the public domain. <em>Yay!</em> I [blogged]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-Happy-Public-Domain-Day %}) about that earlier this month and also shared an ebook of that book that I had designed.

## Novellas
{: tabindex="-1"}

[<cite>Beneath the Sugar Sky</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-08-Reading %}#beneath-the-sugar-sky-by-seanan-mcguire) by Seanan McGuire was another fabulous entry in Seanan McGuire's fabulous <cite>Wayward Children</cite> series.

[<cite>Binti: The Night Masquerade</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-08-Reading %}#binti-the-night-masquerade-by-nnedi-okorafor) by Nnedi Okorafor is a delightful and surprising conclusion to Nnedi Okorafor's <cite>Binti</cite> trilogy.

## <cite>A Canticle for Leibowitz</cite> by Walter M. Miller Jr.
{: tabindex="-1"}

Wow. This science fiction classic is funny, powerful, and stunningly unique, even 60 years later. [I loved it.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-16-Reading %}#a-canticle-for-leibowitz-by-walter-m-miller-jr)

## <cite>A Series of Unfortunate Events</cite> by Lemony Snicket
{: tabindex="-1"}

This series was fun and surprisingly challenging at times. I hadn't read it before, and I'm very glad [I read it]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-16-Reading %}#a-series-of-unfortunate-events-by-lemony-snicket) last year.

## <cite>The Expanse</cite>
{: tabindex="-1"}

<cite>The Expanse</cite> series [remains]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-04-2017-in-Reading %}#the-expanse) [tremendous fun]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-30-Recent-Reading %}#leviathan-wakes-and-babylons-ashes-by-james-sa-corey). If you like space opera, or if you even just like stories set in space, I highly recommend you read this series.

## <cite>The Remnant Fleet</cite> by Geonn Cannon
{: tabindex="-1"}

This was a fun, queer, and relatively short space opera that I stumbled upon. Of course [I loved it.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-30-Recent-Reading %}#the-remnant-fleet-by-geonn-cannon)

## <cite>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</cite> by Liu Cixin
{: tabindex="-1"}

This is the trilogy written by Liu Cixin and comprised of <cite>The Three-Body Problem</cite>, <cite>The Dark Forest</cite>, and <cite>Death’s End</cite> (translated Ken Liu and Joel Martinsen). [I really enjoyed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-30-Recent-Reading %}#the-three-body-problem-the-dark-forest-and-deaths-end-by-liu-cixin-translated-ken-liu-and-joel-martinsen) this imaginative and expansive trilogy.

## Nonfiction Hits
{: tabindex="-1"}

Here's some of the best nonfiction I read in 2018:

* [<cite>Dream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class Is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust, Why That Is a Problem, and What to Do About It</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-08-Reading %}#dream-hoarders-how-the-american-upper-middle-class-is-leaving-everyone-else-in-the-dust-why-that-is-a-problem-and-what-to-do-about-it-by-richard-v-reeves) by Richard Reeves
* [<cite>The Imperial University: Academic Repression and Scholarly Dissent</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-16-Reading %}#the-imperial-university-academic-repression-and-scholarly-dissent-edited-piya-chatterjee-and-sunaina-maira) edited Piya Chatterjee and Sunaina Maira
* [<cite>The Hacked World Order: How Nations Fight, Trade, Maneuver, and Manipulate in the Digital Age</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-16-Reading %}#the-hacked-world-order-how-nations-fight-trade-maneuver-and-manipulate-in-the-digital-age-by-adam-segal) by Adam Segal
* [<cite>Discipline & Punish: The Birth of the Prison</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-31-Discipline-and-Punish %}) by Michel Foucault

## Short Fiction
{: tabindex="-1"}
