No joke, 2017 was a productive, delightful year in reading for me. As a slight disclaimer, however, I will note that on the above list, I have labeled which reads were plays, comics, and poetry, but I have not labeled which reads were novellas --- and I did read a lot of novellas last year.

Now, let's look at some highlights.

## Ann Leckie
{: tabindex="-1"}

Ann Leckie is my new favorite author. She's the space opera goddess for our times. Last winter, I read her [Imperial Radch trilogy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-14-The-Imperial-Radch-Trilogy %}), a profound and enjoyable meditation on empire, identity, and justice. And this past autumn, I read her new book [<cite>Provenance</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-19-Reading %}#provenance-by-ann-leckie), which is basically most of the awesomeness of the Radch trilogy condensed into a smaller tale in a new, fascinating civilization. Ann Leckie is a masterful world builder. She pays careful attention to the details of dress and food, she has a keen eye for class differentials, power imbalances, and issues of justice, and she brilliantly and successfully experiments with gender, politics, and aliens. I kind of want to write a dissertation on her.

## <cite>Fruits Basket</cite>
{: tabindex="-1"}

[<cite>Fruits Basket</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-01-Reading %}#fruits-basket-by-natsuki-takaya) is Danae's favorite manga series. I understand why. I also love it. The series features a huge ensemble of well-developed, likable characters who grow and mature together within a beautiful web of mutual relationships. It's one of those series where, by the time you finish reading it, the characters all really feel like your friends. It's fabulous.

## <cite>Y: The Last Man</cite>
{: tabindex="-1"}

My old community-mate Pat introduced this comic book series to me.
[<cite>Y: The Last Man</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-25-Reading %}#y-the-last-man-by-brian-k-vaughan-and-pia-guerra) tells the story of Yorick Brown and his pet monkey, the only two survivors of a mysterious plague that instantly kills every other mammal with a Y chromosome. It's a post-apocalyptic adventure that's fun, interesting, pulpy, enjoyably stupid, well-plotted, tightly-paced, and featuring great characters. It's tons of fun.

## Nonfiction Hits
{: tabindex="-1"}

I read some great nonfiction this year as well. Stand out nonfiction books are:

- [<cite>Code 2.0</cite> by Lawrence Lessig]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-30-Reading %}#code-20-by-lawrence-lessig)
- [<cite>Tranny: Confessions of Punk Rock's Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout</cite> by Laura Jane Grace]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-01-Reading %}#tranny-confessions-of-punk-rocks-most-infamous-anarchist-sellout-by-laura-jane-grace-with-dan-ozzi)
- [<cite>Islamic Exceptionalism: How the Struggle Over Islam Is Reshaping the World</cite> by Shadi Hamid]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-01-Reading %}#islamic-exceptionalism-how-the-struggle-over-islam-is-reshaping-the-world-by-shadi-hamid)
- [<cite>How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything: Tales from the Pentagon</cite> by Rosa Brooks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-19-Reading %}#how-everything-became-war-and-the-military-became-everything-tales-from-the-pentagon-by-rosa-brooks)

## Awesome Novellas
{: tabindex="-1"}

I read tons of novellas this year. My four favorites are:

- [<cite>All Systems Red</cite> by Martha Wells]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-23-Reading %}#all-systems-red-by-martha-wells)
- [<cite>Passing Strange</cite> by Ellen Klages]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-23-Reading %}#passing-strange-by-ellen-klages)
- [<cite>The Things We Do For Love</cite> by K.J. Parker]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-01-Reading %}#the-things-we-do-for-love-by-kj-parker)
- [<cite>Down Among the Sticks and Bones</cite> by Seanan McGuire]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-25-Reading %}#down-among-the-sticks-and-bones-by-seanan-mcguire)

## <cite>Unlikely Exploits</cite>
{: tabindex="-1"}

Philip Ardagh is one of my favorite children's authors because of his <cite>Eddie Dickens</cite> series. This year, I finally got around to reading one of his other series, the [<cite>Unlikely Exploits</cite>]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-17-Reading %}#the-fall-of-fergal-heir-of-mystery-and-the-rise-of-the-house-of-mcnally-by-philip-ardagh) trilogy. This trilogy is one of the most delightful, genuinely surprising things I've ever read, and I actually like it more than his <cite>Eddie Dickens</cite> series (which is still very close to my heart). The three books in this trilogy are:

- <cite>The Fall of Fergal</cite> by Philip Ardagh
- <cite>Heir of Mystery</cite> by Philip Ardagh
- <cite>The Rise of the House of McNally</cite> by Philip Ardagh

## <cite>The Expanse</cite>
{: tabindex="-1"}

[*The Expanse*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-19-Reading %}#nemesis-games-by-james-sa-corey) remains at the top on my "Generally Recommended" list. Put simply, *The Expanse* series by James S.A. Corey is the most fun I've ever had reading --- yes, I find it more fun than *Harry Potter*. The first book in the series is *Leviathan Wakes*. Go read that. This past December, I read *Nemesis Games*, the fifth book in the series, and like every other book in the series, it totally rocked.

The series also has a TV show (also called *The Expanse*) airing on Syfy. It's third season starts soon. Go watch it. To my mind, it's the best show currently on air.
