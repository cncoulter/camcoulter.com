## “The Scrimshaw and the Scream” by Kate Hall

Not bad.

## “Making the Cut” by H.E. Roulo
{: tabindex="-1"}

An interesting take on superheroes.

## “[The Dryad’s Shoe](http://www.fantasy-magazine.com/new/new-fiction/the-dryads-shoe/)” by T. Kingfisher

AWESOME.

A reimagining of Cinderella which asks: what if, instead of wanting to go to balls and marry the prince, Cinderella just wanted to garden? This short story examines class, vocation, and gender in fun, interesting ways, and it’s got beautiful dialogue.

## “Drowning in Sky” by Julia August
{: tabindex="-1"}

I can’t say I really got this one.

## “Miss Carstairs and the Merman” by Delia Sherman
{: tabindex="-1"}

A good, interesting story, although a bit dull. If you like 19th-century lady scientists, this one is for you.

## “Silver or Gold” by Emma Bull
{: tabindex="-1"}

This one was pretty cool, although it didn’t leave a strong impression with me.

## “The Abominable Child’s Tale” by Carol Emshwiller
{: tabindex="-1"}

This story was awesome. Go read it. It’s told in the first person, from a child’s point of view. The plot is good, but the narration and point of view is handled so well that you just need to go read it now.

## “The Glass Bottle Trick” by Nalo Hopkinson
{: tabindex="-1"}

A good story! It starts off slow, but the ending is definitely worth it.
