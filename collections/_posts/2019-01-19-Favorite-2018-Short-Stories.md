Last year, I wrote a [short fiction review column](https://skiffyandfanty.com/author/cameronncoulter/) for <cite>Skiffy and Fanty</cite>. By my count, I read almost 300 pieces of short fiction originally published in 2018. There's also an uncounted number of short stories that I started reading but didn't finish. I also read one anthology and one collection of short stories that were published before 2018, both of which [were awesome]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-30-Recent-Reading %}#transcendent-the-years-best-transgender-speculative-fiction-edited-by-km-szpara).

It turns out I definitely have favorite magazines and authors and themes.

<b>Magazines.</b> [<cite>Uncanny Magazine</cite>](https://uncannymagazine.com/) and [<cite>Lightspeed Magazine</cite>](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/) reliably published stories I loved. I really loved [<cite>Capricious</cite>](http://www.capricioussf.org/) and [<cite>Anathema</cite>](http://www.anathemamag.com/) as well.

<b>Authors.</b> With any of these authors, it was a safe bet that I'd love the story: Bogi Tak√°cs, Carrie Vaughn, Katharine Duckett, A. Merc Rustad, Nino Cipri, and K.M. Szpara.

<b>Themes.</b> As you'll notice below, the bulk of stories that resonated with me were feminist and represented QUILTBAG+ characters. Other themes that resonated with me included dis/ability, community, religion.

Here are my favorite pieces of short fiction that were originally published in 2018:

<b>"[You Can Make a Dinosaur, but You Can‚Äôt Help Me](https://uncannymagazine.com/article/you-can-make-a-dinosaur-but-you-cant-help-me/)" by K.M.
